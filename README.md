Personal Goals

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching Goals for 2017
1. Build Community
2. Complete pivot into tech
3. Contribute to Open Source
4. Advanced iOS
5. Remember mind & body (Reading/Exercise)
